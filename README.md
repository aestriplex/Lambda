# Lambda [Work in progress]

A python library to automate the developing of symbolic tests that works on top of Z3 bindings.

## Current developments

Currently I am developing the bindings for the [JS standard library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)

## TODO
* Function call support
* References (and pointers) support
* Multithread support
